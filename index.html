            <h2>Adding emojis to the end of every word.</h2>
            <p>
                Emojis have become a fun way to communicate. One of the most entertaining uses, to me, has always been the clapping hands in between words: 
                <img src="img/tweet-2.png" alt="screenshot of tweet that reads, 'I am so ready to go home', with a clapping-hands emoji in betwwen each word. The identity of the tweeter has been concealed for privacy" /> 
                Emojis are a great way to convey text and tone. The clapping-hands emoji in between each word has always been my favorite way to show exasperation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem is that emojis can make content difficult to parse when using assistive technology (AT) such as a screenreader. &nbsp; 
                Most people who use screenreaders have reported some sort of disability (click <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/">here</a> for an annual report on screenreader usage). &nbsp;
                Let's see how unedited emojis sound to a screenreader.

            <form class="flex-column" id="form">
                <label for="emoji-text">Type anything and I'll add the <span role="img" aria-label="clap">&#128079;</span> emoji to the end of every word.</label>
                <textarea id="emoji-text" maxlength="194"></textarea>
                <div class="count-container">
                    <input id="emoji-submit" type="submit" value="Listen" />
                    <span id="character-count">0/194</span>
                </div>

        <section class="examples flex-column" id="rendered">
            <h2>Emojis rendered properly</h2>
            <p>Frontend developers interested in accessiblity may have seen code examples that take advantage of the role and aria-label attributes available to an element, as well as the unicode for the emoji:
                <code>
                    [TODO: add code snippet of span here]
                </code>
                Many people pat themselves on the back at this point. The problem is that an accessible website might not be usable for people with disbilities. 
                The word "image" will be appended to the end of your label. It would still be difficult to read an entire sentence.
                <span id="rendered-text" class="dynamic-examples"></span>
                <button id="rendered-text-button" type="button">Listen</button>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="examples flex-column" id="raw">
            <h2>No emojis</h2>
            <p>
                Like all important information, it's good to stick with the substance and remove emojis.
                <span id="raw-text" class="dynamic-examples"></span>
                <button id="raw-text-button" type="button">Listen</button>
            </p>
            <h3>Moderation is key</h3>
            People both with and without disabilities use emojis as a fun form of communication. 
            It's important that we as developers take on the burden of ensuring that our content is readable and meaningful to the entirety of its audience. 
            Maybe we can avoid all tweets like this in the future: 
            <img src="img/tweet-1.png" alt="screenshot of tweet consisting of approximately 127 and 3 heart emojis, followed by #ThanksHealthHeroes. There is also an image feature the same hashtag in decorated font. The identity of the tweeter has been concealed for privacy"
